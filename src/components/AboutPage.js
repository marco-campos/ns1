        <p>I am a PhD student at the University of Houston studying Computational Topology.</p>
        <p>I previously taught AP Calculus, Pre-Calculus and OnRamps Pre-Calculus at Sharpstown High School. My passion for mathematics extended beyond the classroom as I founded and led a math team with a focus on the number sense UIL competitions.

The unexpected turn of events brought by the Covid lockdown presented unique challenges. It was during this time that the seeds for this web application were sown where I went down a rabbithole and developed an initial version of the app, albeit a bit rough around the edges, to ensure that my students could continue their training uninterrupted.

The dream, however, was much bigger. I envisioned a comprehensive platform that could be accessed by any student with the drive to excel in math competitions. I wanted the questions to be uniquely generated, high scores to be tracked, weaknesses to be recognized.

Today, this web application is the first step towards the realization of that vision. 

It is my sincere hope that this platform will play a role in the journey of many students, perhaps even that of a future state champion.</p>
